## 1. Overview
The Log Visualization App is a platform to upload, visualize, and analyze log files in real-time through **Sequence Diagrams**. The app processes log files using JavaScript and JSON construction, requiring no backend or database. It operates entirely on the web, making it lightweight and easy to deploy.

## 2. Features
- Upload log files for processing.
- Real-time data visualization through SEQUENCE DIAGRAMS.
- JSON-based log construction for dynamic visualization.
- Filtering options for log events.
- Export visualized data as JSON or image.
- Search and highlight specific log entries.
- Auto-updating log data with a refresh feature.

## 3. Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React (Vite), HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Data Handling**: JavaScript and JSON construction (no database)
- **Data Visualization Library**: React Sequence diagrams(<https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-sequence-diagram>)
- **Package Manager**: npm/yarn
- **Version Control**: Git

## 4. System Requirements
- Node.js v14.x or above
- npm v6.x or above / yarn v1.x or above
- Any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- 4GB RAM or above (for local setup)

## 5. Installation Guide

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <https://github.com/korayv/gnc>
cd log-visualization-app

## 7. Usage

### Uploading Log Files
1. Navigate to the file upload section.
2. Select the log file from your system.
3. Click on "Upload" to start processing.

### Visualizing Logs
- Choose the SEQUENCE diagram option for visualization.
- Apply filters (e.g., time range, event types).
- Use the search bar to locate specific log entries.

### Interacting with SEQUENCE Diagrams
- Hover over events in the SEQUENCE diagram for detailed information.
- Zoom in/out for finer control.
- Download the diagram as an image or export the log data in JSON format.

## 8. Visual Representation of Logs
- **SEQUENCE Diagram**: Depicts the flow of events over time in a sequential manner, showing the interactions between different parts of the system in chronological order.

## 9. Error Handling and Logging
- Error messages are displayed when log files fail to upload or when data cannot be visualized.
- JavaScript handles all errors within the browser, and error logs are accessible via the browser console.
- Alerts are shown for invalid log file formats or empty logs.

## 10. Testing

### Unit Tests
Use `Jest` or another testing framework to test individual components.
```bash
npm test
